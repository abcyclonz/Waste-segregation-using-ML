Waste Segregation Using Machine Learning  

The **Waste Segregation System** leverages machine learning to classify and segregate waste into categories such as plastic, metal, cardboard, and others. The system utilizes a neural network model trained on a diverse dataset of images, ensuring high accuracy in identifying various types of waste materials. This project aims to streamline the recycling process by automating waste sorting, thereby reducing manual effort and improving efficiency.  

The system captures images of waste materials using a camera, processes them using image classification algorithms, and assigns each item to its appropriate category. The neural network analyzes features like texture, color, and shape to differentiate between materials. This real-time classification helps minimize contamination in recycling streams and supports sustainable waste management practices.  

By integrating this system into waste disposal units, industries, municipalities, and households can contribute to environmental conservation and achieve efficient resource management.
